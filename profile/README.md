# Welcome to Astra Development!

Astra Development is a public organization for people who are interested in discussing development ideas, sharing their thoughts, and helping us grow.

## Working Projects

Our current project is [AstraBots](https://astrabots.xyz), a website for Discord bot and server owners. You can advertise your bots and servers, vote for them, and check out details of other bots and servers.

We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels. If you're interested in getting involved, please reach out to us through our website or GitHub repository.

Thank you for joining us at Astra Development!
